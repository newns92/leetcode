/*
You are given a dataset that provides the number of active users per day per premium account.

A premium account will have an entry for every day that itâ€™s premium. 

However, a premium account may be temporarily discounted and considered not paid, this is indicated by a value of 0 in the final_price column for a certain day. 

Find out how many premium accounts that are paid on any given day are still premium and paid 7 days later.

Output the date, the number of premium and paid accounts on that day, and the number of how many of these accounts are still premium and paid 7 days later. 

Since you are only given data for a 14 days period, only include the first 7 available dates in your output.
